              we used the following way to use CommandRepo because
              
              If a Singleton (EventProcessor) service depends on a Scoped service (CommandRepo), we have 
              a “Lifetime mismatch” which means in the context of dependency injection “the situation where 
              a service with a longer lifetime depends on a service with a shorter lifetime”. 

              This is because the Singleton service is expected to exist for the entire application’s lifetime, 
              but the Scoped service it depends on is only available for a specific request or scope.
              When the scope ends, the Scoped service is disposed of, but the Singleton service still exists and 
              may try to access the now non-existent Scoped service. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

              To avoid this, it’s generally recommended that services with longer lifetimes should not depend on services 
              with shorter lifetimes. Instead, they should depend on services with the same or longer lifetimes. 
              This ensures that all the services a given service depends on are available for its entire lifetime.
